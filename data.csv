Stupidest service ever!,"The product is fine, but the installation service is absolutely bonkers. First if all, Amazon's installation information states the installation cost includes sealing the border gaps using ""heat insulating material"" which according to the technicians and the service center manager, refers to ""pieces of ply wood"". Secondly, installation includes ""fitting the ply wood only"", wherein the said ply wood needs to either be provided by the customer or bought from the technicians at absurd prices. I got the borders sealed via my building manager instead, saved quite a few bucks!
